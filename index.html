    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Rafael L.S Reis, a proud Computer Science major at California State University, Monterey Bay, set to graduate in December 2025. My journey in tech is more than a career pursuit—it’s a mission fueled by curiosity, compassion, and a desire to create meaningful change.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Computer Science is my passion, not just because it allows me to solve problems, but because it empowers me to create tools that make life better for others. As a Teaching Assistant at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, I witness firsthand the challenges faced by students from diverse, socioeconomically impacted backgrounds. I know what it means to face obstacles and persist, and I am dedicated to helping others navigate these hurdles, offering support and mentorship to those who need it most.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a Latino in tech, I take pride in representing and uplifting underrepresented voices in STEM. I believe in the power of education and opportunity to transform lives, and I strive to create spaces where students—especially minorities—can thrive. Whether through teaching, mentoring, or research, I work to empower others, fostering a culture of equity and inclusion in every space I inhabit.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Ethics and responsibility guide my approach to technology. I believe that innovation must not come at the expense of humanity. My research focuses on sustainability, ensuring that the tools we build today don’t burden future generations. Beyond the code, I want my work to contribute to a fairer, more inclusive society—one where every individual, regardless of background, has the opportunity to succeed.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        This e-portfolio is a reflection of my journey, my values, and my aspirations. It is a space where I share not just my accomplishments but the impact I hope to create. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and the work I am so passionate about.
