    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Rafael L.S Reis, a proud Computer Science major at California State University, Monterey Bay, set to graduate in December 2025. My journey in tech is more than a career pursuit—it’s a mission fueled by curiosity, compassion, and a desire to create meaningful change.

        Computer Science is my passion, not just because it allows me to solve problems, but because it empowers me to create tools that make life better for others. As a Teaching Assistant at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, I witness firsthand the challenges faced by students from diverse, socioeconomically impacted backgrounds. I know what it means to face obstacles and persist, and I am dedicated to helping others navigate these hurdles, offering support and mentorship to those who need it most.

        As a Latino in tech, I take pride in representing and uplifting underrepresented voices in STEM. I believe in the power of education and opportunity to transform lives, and I strive to create spaces where students—especially minorities—can thrive. Whether through teaching, mentoring, or research, I work to empower others, fostering a culture of equity and inclusion in every space I inhabit.

        Ethics and responsibility guide my approach to technology. I believe that innovation must not come at the expense of humanity. My research focuses on sustainability, ensuring that the tools we build today don’t burden future generations. Beyond the code, I want my work to contribute to a fairer, more inclusive society—one where every individual, regardless of background, has the opportunity to succeed.
